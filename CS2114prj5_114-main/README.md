Communication Plan
The preferred mode of communication for our team is group chat. We have agreed on the following expectations:




Response Time:
Within 24 hours under normal circumstances.
Within 4 hours during the 2 days leading up to a project deadline.
This ensures we maintain consistent collaboration and handle any issues quickly before submission.



Deadline Plan
To ensure smooth integration of all parts and time for debugging and revisions, our team agrees to the following deadline structure:
Internal Team Deadline:
Set two days before the official project deadline.
All individual contributions should be submitted by this internal deadline.
This allows time to combine work, debug issues, and ensure all requirements are metâ€”even if a team member needs assistance finishing their part.
